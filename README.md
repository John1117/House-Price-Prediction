# House Price Prediction

This project is about the [House Price Prediction Contest](https://tbrain.trendmicro.com.tw/Competitions/Details/30) hosted by Sinopac Holdings and Trend Micro in 2023. We aimed to predict house-prices-per-area (or called unit-price) based on various features using machine learning techniques. It employed a dataset that includes attributes such as the number of rooms, location, size, and other factors that influence house pricing.
